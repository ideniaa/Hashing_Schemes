# Hashing_Schemes
Chain Hashing, Linear Probe Hashing, Double Hashing

This program lets user enter the name of the input data file, the hashing scheme, and the load factor. The first value in the file (N) is the amount of records included in the file. The first value of each record is the key and the rest is the value. After all entries are inserted, the program will print table size, average number of probes, and max number of probes for the worst case.
